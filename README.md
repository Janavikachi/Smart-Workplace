## OCR Setup Instructions

To use the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) feature in the whiteboard, you need to install Tesseract OCR:

### Windows Installation:

1. Download Tesseract OCR:
   - Go to https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki
   - Download the latest installer (e.g., `tesseract-ocr-w64-setup-5.3.1.20230401.exe` for 64-bit Windows)

2. Install Tesseract:
   - Run the downloaded installer
   - Choose the installation directory (default is usually `C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR`)
   - **Important**: Remember the installation path

3. Add Tesseract to System PATH:
   - Open Windows Search and type "Environment Variables"
   - Click "Edit the system environment variables"
   - Click "Environment Variables" button
   - Under "System Variables", find and select "Path"
   - Click "Edit"
   - Click "New"
   - Add the Tesseract installation path (e.g., `C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR`)
   - Click "OK" on all windows

4. Verify Installation:
   - Open a new Command Prompt
   - Type `tesseract --version`
   - If you see version information, the installation was successful

### Troubleshooting OCR:

1. If `tesseract` command is not recognized:
   - Double-check that you added the correct path to System PATH
   - Try restarting your computer
   - Verify the installation by checking if the Tesseract folder exists in Program Files

2. If OCR is not working in the application:
   - Make sure Tesseract is properly installed and in PATH
   - Check if the Python package `pytesseract` is installed
   - Ensure you have proper permissions to access the Tesseract installation

3. For better OCR results:
   - Ensure good lighting when using the whiteboard
   - Write clearly and legibly
   - Use contrasting colors (dark text on light background)
   - Keep the text size reasonable
